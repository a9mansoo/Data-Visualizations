**Where's Waldo?**  

This was one of the most popular children's books worldwide in the last few decades.  The book would present a picture across two pages crowded with small  colourful cartoon drawings of people,  animals, and objects. These would be in a variety of poses and would appear anywhere over both pages.  Amongst the many people and animals appearing  all over both pages would be the character called Waldo (or Wally in some countries).  The objective was to find Waldo somewhere in each complex picture.

A Dr. Randy Olson (presently at the University of Pennsylvania) appears to have determined all the locations of Waldo across a series of these children's books (don't ask me why). 

```{r}
waldo <- read.csv("wheres-waldo-locations.csv", header=TRUE)
head(waldo)
```


The second line will print the first  few rows of the data and reveal that it has four different variates: `Book`, `Page`, `X`, and `Y`.  The first two are self explanatory and the last two are Cartesian coordinates for the actual location of Waldo on that page in that book.


## Density of Points with alpha blending

```{r}
x <- waldo$X
y <- waldo$Y

x_lim <- c(min(x), max(x))
y_lim <- c(min(y)-1, max(y) + 1)

plot(x, y, pch=19, cex=4.5, xlim= x_lim, ylim=y_lim, col=adjustcolor("blue", alpha=0.5))

```

It appears that Waldo tends to appear in the middle of the page, the bottom right or the bottom left of the page. 

## Density plot with hexagonal binning

```{r}
library("hexbin")
hexbinplot(y ~ x, data=waldo, xbins=10, main="Hexagonal Waldo locations", colramp=function(n) rev(grey.colors(n)), aspect=1)
hexbinplot(y ~ x, data=waldo, style="lattice", xbins=10, main="Hexagonal Waldo locations",  aspect=1)

```

From the hexagonal plot where the colours show the count, the darkest colours are seen in the centre and bottom left of the plot. 

From the hexagonal plot where the size shows the count, largest hexagons are seen in the centre and centre right and the bottom left of the plot. 

## Contours of density estimate for Waldo's positions

```{r}
library(MASS)
den <- kde2d(x, y, n=68)
zlim <- range(den$z)
plot(x,y, pch=19, col=adjustcolor("steelblue", 0.5), main="Waldo locations Contour")
contour(den$x, den$y, den$z, col="blue", levels= pretty(zlim, 10), lwd=1, add=TRUE)
```

- Start looking for Waldo at the centre of the page where the level curve is 0.016 or in the bottom left of the page where the level curve is also 0.016. 

- Waldo is least likely to appear at the edges of the page where the level curves are 0.002 and 0.004. 

## Two Dimensional kernel density Estimates for Waldo's positions conditional on each book

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mapping = aes(x, y), data=waldo) +
  geom_density_2d() +
  facet_grid(.~Book)

```

Yes the author has changed the positions over time for each book. 
For book 1, waldo appears mostly on the top left hand side. 
In book 2, his distribution is more spread out similar to 3 but there are concentrated
regions. 
In book 4, waldo appears mostly on the bottom right hand side. 
Book 5 and 6 he has a varying distribution. 
In Book 7, he appears the most in the center, top left and bottom right side of the book.
