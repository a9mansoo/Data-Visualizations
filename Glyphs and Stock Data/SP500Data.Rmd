```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
set.seed(12314159)
```



**S\&P 500 data** 

```{r SP500Setup}
library(qrmdata)
data("SP500_const") # load the constituents data from qrmdata
time <- c("2007-01-03", "2009-12-31") # specify time period
data_sp500 <- SP500_const[paste0(time, collapse = "/"),] # grab out data
cases <- complete.cases(t(data_sp500))
x <- t(na.omit(t(data_sp500))) # omit the missing data
SP500_omitNA <- split(x,col(x)) # split the data into list
```

We will work primarily with the data `SP500_omitNA` since it contains only companies having **complete** series for this time period.  These are identified in the original data by the
    
The S\&P 500 companies are grouped by `Sector` and by `Subsector`.  The `Sector` names can be found using 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
levels(SP500_const_info$Sector)
```
    
There are `r length(levels(SP500_const_info$Sector))` different sectors.  Interest here lies in the average behaviour of the stocks in each sector.  To help in calculation, use the following function to calculate averages for any subset in the list of stock series in `data`.
    
```{r aveSelection}
aveSelection <- function(data, selection) {
  # selection is a subset of indices whose
  # values are to be extracted from the data
  # and averaged.
  n <- length(selection)
  ave <- Reduce("+", data[selection])/n
  # return ave
  ave
    }
```
    
For example, the average over all of the complete cases in the S\&P 500 data is found as
    
```{r}
aveAllComplete <- aveSelection(SP500_omitNA, 1:length(SP500_omitNA))
```
    
The first few elements of which are
    
```{r}
head(aveAllComplete)
```
    
Another handy function will be one which locates the indices of the sector from the sector information.  This function will be
```{r locateSector}
locateSector <- function(sectorInfo, sector) {which(sectorInfo == sector)}
```
    
For example, the first few indices in for stocks in the list of all stocks in the ``Financials`` sector would be
    
```{r}
head(locateSector(SP500_const_info$Sector, "Financials"))
```
    
and those in the **complete** cases (no NAs) would be
    
```{r}
head(locateSector(SP500_const_info$Sector[cases], "Financials"))

```
    
These may be the same stocks but have different indices (the first in the set of all stocks, the second only in that subset containing stocks with no NAs).

## Constructing list of averages over all stocks of the sectors
    
```{r}

# List contains the average of each days from the different indices for each sector

sectors <- levels(SP500_const_info$Sector)

average <- lapply(sectors, function(x) aveSelection(SP500_omitNA, locateSector(SP500_const_info$Sector[cases], x)))


names(average) <- sectors

for (i in 1:length(average)){
  print(average[[i]][1])
}

```
    
    
We are now going to construct a variety of glyphs for each of these 10 sectors. For **all** of the displays below, a 21 colour **divergent** colour palette from red to blue (with **low** values being red and **high** values blue), **AND** the "median" as the value of the origin when making all glyphs. The following shortnames may be used for labels:
```{r}
sectorShortNames <- c("Industry", "Health", "Info Tech", "Finance",
                      "Discretionary", "Utilities", "Materials",
                      "Staples", "Energy", "Telecom")
```
    
## Hilbert Glyphs

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   install.packages("remotes")
   remotes::install_github("rwoldford/glyphs")
```

```{r}
   unloadNamespace("glyphs")
   library(glyphs)
   library(colorspace)
   
   cols <- rev(diverge_hcl(21)) # low is red, blue is high and grey is median
   
   # change names of averages to short names 
   sectorShortNames <- c("Discretionary","Staples", "Energy", "Finance", "Health", "Industry", "Info Tech","Materials","Telecom"
                      ,"Utilities")
   
   names(average) <- sectorShortNames
   
   SP500Hilbert <- make_glyphs(average, 
                               glyph_type = "Hilbert", 
                               origin = "median", col=cols)
   
   doit <- function (glyphs, main ="", labels = NULL, labelCol = "grey30") {
x <- getGridXY(length(glyphs)) # get coordinates for each glyph
plot_glyphs(x, glyphs = glyphs, axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "",
glyphWidth = 0.8, glyphHeight = 0.6,
main = main, cex.main = 0.8)
if (!is.null(labels)) text(x, labels = labels, col = labelCol)
}
   doit(SP500Hilbert[1:10], main="Hilbert- Sector averages", labels= names(average))
```
 
 
The glyphs are shaped this way because Hilbert glyphs compare the average for the
time series in a half box way ( ] ) where the origin is the median. 
So we compare the first year average from the top left then move onto the second
year moving to the right and then the last year at the bottom. 

It appears the Telecom and Finance sector look similar, as they start with
high values of the average than the median and move closer to the median value in the second year 
and in the last year we see red values indicating averages lower than the median. 

The Industry and Info Tech also look similar starting with median values (grey)
then having some higher averages from the median with light blue values in the middle of the second year 
then moving to lower averages than the median in the last year. 

It appears that the Telecom and Finance sectors have fared the worst in the last year
since they started with higher average values than the median and then progressively 
had lower average values than the median. 

In terms of faring the worst in general, the Staple sectors has mostly grey values
since the beginning and then has the low average values. 
 
## Morton Glyphs

```{r}
cols <- rev(diverge_hcl(21)) # low is red, blue is high and grey is median
   
   # change names of averages to short names 
   sectorShortNames <- c("Discretionary","Staples", "Energy", "Finance", "Health", "Industry", "Info Tech","Materials","Telecom"
                      ,"Utilities")
   
   names(average) <- sectorShortNames
   
   SP500Morton <- make_glyphs(average, 
                               glyph_type = "Morton", 
                               origin = "median", col=cols)
   
   str(SP500Morton)
   
   doit <- function (glyphs, main ="", labels = NULL, labelCol = "grey30") {
x <- getGridXY(length(glyphs)) # get coordinates for each glyph
plot_glyphs(x, glyphs = glyphs, axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "",
glyphWidth = 0.8, glyphHeight = 0.6,
main = main, cex.main = 0.8)
if (!is.null(labels)) text(x, labels = labels, col = labelCol)
}
   doit(SP500Morton[1:10], main="Morton- Sector averages", labels= names(average))
```

The Morton glyphs compare the averages in a Z shape. So we compare the first 
and second year, then diagonally compare the second and third year averages.

The Finance and Telecom sector look the similar since they start with higher
averages than the median values then have median values noted by the grey with 
a little low averages then have low averages than the median. 

The Industry and Info Tech sectors look similar with grey values indicating the 
median with partial specs of blue values indicating high values than the average 
than the median. Then they have low values of the average than the median. 

The Finance and Telecom sector fare the worst since they intially start with 
high averages than the median values then move into the grey region and 
red region. 

From the perspective of faring the worst overall, the Staples industry has 
grey values (median values) in the beginning and then have low averages (red)
values later on. 

## Keim Glyphs


```{r}
cols <- rev(diverge_hcl(21)) # low is red, blue is high and grey is median
   
   # change names of averages to short names 
   sectorShortNames <- c("Discretionary","Staples", "Energy", "Finance", "Health", "Industry", "Info Tech","Materials","Telecom"
                      ,"Utilities")
   
   names(average) <- sectorShortNames
   
   # 5 columns of one row, 1 column of 4 rows, 12 columns of 1 row, 1 column of
   # 3 rows. 
   width <- c(5,1,12,1)
   height <- c(1, 4, 1, 3)
   
   
   SP500Kiem <- make_glyphs(average, 
                               glyph_type = "rectangle",
                               width = width, height = height,
                               origin = "median", col=cols)
   
   doit <- function (glyphs, main ="", labels = NULL, labelCol = "grey30") {
x <- getGridXY(length(glyphs)) # get coordinates for each glyph
plot_glyphs(x, glyphs = glyphs, axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "",
glyphWidth = 0.8, glyphHeight = 0.6,
main = main, cex.main = 0.8)
if (!is.null(labels)) text(x, labels = labels, col = labelCol)
}
   doit(SP500Kiem[1:10], main="Kiem- Sector averages", labels= names(average))
```

The Kiem glyphs compare the years in a backwards S shape. We start the comparison
of each year from the top left, move across all the way to the top right then the
second year is in the middle and the last year is at the bottom. 

The Finance and Telecom sectors look similar with high averages then the
median (blue values) across the first year, in the middle mostly median values denoted 
by the grey values and then red values in the last year. 

The Industry and Info Tech look similar. The Health and Staples look kind of similar
to Industry and Info Tech but Health has some red at the beginning and so does 
Staples which has some light red. 

The Finance and Telecom fared the worst according to starting with the higher averages
than the median and then grey values and then low averages than the median in 
the last year. 

In terms of faring badly in general, the staples section appears to be
faring the worst since most values are grey for the first few years and then
it enter the red values zone in the last years. 

These glyphs are superior because there is a more natural comparison over
the years of the time series compared to the Hilbert and Morton glyphs. 
It's as if we are moving past a calendar and checking how well the sectors
are doing.
